# Data Analysis of Police Data using Pandas and Python


# Overview:
This repository contains a data analysis of car data using Pandas and Python. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and contains details of used cars in Germany which are on sale on eBay.

## Data Cleaning:
The dataset was not clean, so a lot of data cleaning was carried out. For example, prices that were too high were replaced by the median, and outliers were removed accordingly.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Once the data was clean, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed. This involved using visualizations and statistical methods to understand the characteristics of the data, identify patterns and trends, and test hypotheses.


## How to Use:
To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and install the required dependencies. Then, you can run the Python scripts to perform the data analysis yourself.

## Dependencies:

1. Python 3.6 or higher
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn

## Instructions:

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
1. git clone https://github.com/MykeShale/Police-Data-Analysis.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Python scripts to perform the data analysis:
5. python exploratory_data_analysis.py
This will generate a number of visualizations and statistics that you can use to understand the data. You can also modify the Python scripts to perform your own analysis.

## Contributing:
